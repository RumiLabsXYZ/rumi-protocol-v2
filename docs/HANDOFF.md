## ✅ COMPLETED: Staging Branch Merge (February 4, 2026)

### Merge Summary

The long-stranded `staging` branch (57 commits) has been successfully merged into `main`. This recovers all of Agnes's work from Fall 2025 that was blocked due to a workflow disruption.

**Merge Commit:** `1cb0034` - "Merge staging into main: Treasury, Stability Pool, partial vault operations, II improvements"

**Additional Commit:** `477a89d` - Cherry-picked LICENSE and ACKNOWLEDGMENTS files from `feature/liquidation-price-check`

### What Was Merged

| Feature | Description | Author |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Treasury Canister** | Protocol fee collection and management | Agnes |
| **Stability Pool Canister** | Liquidation pool for protocol stability | Agnes |
| **Partial Vault Operations** | `partial_repay_to_vault`, `partial_liquidate_vault` endpoints | Agnes |
| **Internet Identity Improvements** | Better II integration and state persistence | Agnes |
| **WalletSelector Component** | New wallet selection UI component | Agnes |
| **Stability Pool UI** | Frontend components for stability pool | Agnes |
| **Various Bug Fixes** | Multiple fixes across frontend and backend | Agnes |

### Conflict Resolution Details

8 files had merge conflicts. Here's how each was resolved:

| File | Resolution | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| `canister_ids.json` | Kept main's treasury ID (`tlg74-oiaaa-aaaap-qrd6a-cai`) | Main has the currently deployed production canister IDs |
| `dfx.json` | Merged main's clean structure + added `internet_identity` and `xrc` canisters from staging | Combined best of both: main's simple canister configs without embedded init_args, plus staging's new canister definitions |
| `rumi_protocol_backend.did` | Combined partial operations from staging + ICRC-21/28/10 standards from main | Main had critical Oisy wallet standards; staging had new partial operations |
| `config.ts` | Kept main's canister IDs | Main has production-deployed canister IDs |
| `auth.ts` | Kept main's version | Main has comprehensive Oisy wallet integration and session restoration logic |
| `apiClient.ts` | Kept main's version | Main has complete Treasury service implementation and better imports |
| `+layout.svelte` | Kept main's version | Main has enhanced sidebar layout with better navigation |
| `LoadingSpinner.svelte` | Kept main's version | Main's version is parameterized (size, color props) |

### Backup Branch

A backup was created before merging: `main-backup-feb4`

If anything goes wrong, you can restore with:
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard main-backup-feb4
git push origin main --force
```

### Deferred Work

The `feature/liquidation-price-check` branch has one remaining commit that was NOT merged due to conflicts:
- **Commit:** `4169380` - "fix: add price freshness validation to liquidation endpoints"
- **Files affected:** `src/rumi_protocol_backend/src/main.rs`, `src/rumi_protocol_backend/src/xrc.rs`
- **What it does:** Adds `validate_price_for_liquidation()` helper to enforce price staleness checks on liquidation endpoints
- **Action needed:** Merge this separately after testing the current merge

---

## Development Workflow (Agreed Feb 5, 2026)

### Roles
- **Rob**: UI/UX improvements, cleanup, testing. Submits PRs.
- **Agnes**: Feature development, PR review, merge authority.

### Git Flow
1. Work on feature branches
2. Deploy to **staging canister** for validation
3. Submit PR to `main`, Agnes reviews and merges
4. Deploy `main` to **production canister**

### Staging Deployment — PENDING SETUP
Agnes proposed deploying to staging before production. Details TBD:
- Need a separate frontend canister on mainnet for staging
- Unclear if a `staging` git branch is needed or if feature branches deploy directly
- **Rob messaged Agnes to clarify** (Feb 6) — waiting on response
- Until staging is set up, deployments go straight to production (current behavior)

### Remaining Merge Tasks

1. **Merge price validation fix** (in separate session):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git cherry-pick 4169380
   # Resolve conflicts in main.rs
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Clean up branches** (optional):
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete staging  # If no longer needed
   git branch -d main-backup-feb4    # After confirming stability
   ```

## ✅ COMPLETED: Send/Receive Feature + UI Polish (February 5, 2026)

### Branch: `feature/ii-wallet-send-receive`

Planned Jan 27, Phase 1 built Jan 27, completed and deployed to mainnet Feb 5.
All changes deployed on vault_frontend canister `tcfua-yaaaa-aaaap-qrd7q-cai`.

### New Files Created (Jan 27 – Feb 5)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `components/common/Toast.svelte` | Auto-dismiss notification component |
| `components/common/Modal.svelte` | Reusable modal with DOM portal pattern |
| `components/wallet/ReceiveModal.svelte` | QR code + principal display for receiving |
| `components/wallet/SendModal.svelte` | ICP/icUSD transfer UI for II users |
| `services/transferService.ts` | ICRC-1 transfer logic for ICP and icUSD |
| `utils/principalHelpers.ts` | `truncatePrincipal()` and `copyToClipboard()` |

### 1. Transfer Service Fix

**File:** `transferService.ts`
- Changed `pnp.getActor()` → `walletStore.getActor()` for creating ledger actors
- `walletStore.getActor()` (in `auth.ts`) detects II and uses delegation identity agent
- Fixed "Cannot create signed actor. No wallet provider connected." error
- ICP and icUSD transfers now work for II users via `icrc1_transfer`

### 2. Internet Identity Portal URL

**Files:** `internetIdentity.ts` and `auth.ts`
- Changed II provider from `https://identity.ic0.app` to `https://id.ai`

### 3. Modal Portal Fix

**File:** `Modal.svelte`
- DOM portal pattern: modal `onMount` appends to `document.body`
- Fixes stacking context issues (modals were rendering above viewport)
- Fixes click-outside-to-close (backdrop click checks `event.target === backdropEl`)
- Removed Svelte transitions that conflicted with portal approach

### 4. Header Wallet Pill Redesign

**File:** `WalletConnector.svelte`

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| USD values in header | Removed (kept in dropdown only) |
| All balances equal weight | icUSD primary (bright, bold), ICP secondary (muted) |
| Principal same size as balances | Tiny mono metadata text (30% opacity) |
| Controls mixed with data | Vertical divider separates data from controls |

Reading order: Wallet icon → icUSD balance → ICP balance → controls

### 5. Wallet Dropdown Polish

- Truncated principal at top, clickable to copy (hover turns purple)
- Balance rows with token icons, USD values muted
- icUSD always shown (even at 0)
- Action buttons: Receive, Send (II only), Refresh Balance, Disconnect
- Disabled Send/Receive for non-II wallets with tooltip

### 6. Receive Modal with QR Code

- QR code as visual anchor (via `qrcode` npm v1.5.4)
- Principal below in mono block
- Helper text: "Use this address to receive ICP or icUSD."
- Copy Principal button

### 7. Toast Repositioning

- Container: `position: fixed; top: 4.5rem; right: 1rem`
- Below header, never overlaps wallet pill
- `z-index: 8000` (above content, below modals at 9000)
- Multiple toasts stack downward, auto-dismiss 3.5s

### 8. GitHub Icon in Header

**File:** `+layout.svelte`
- GitHub SVG icon added next to email and Twitter social links
- Links to `https://github.com/RumiLabsXYZ/rumi-protocol-v2`

### 9. WalletConnector Click-Outside Fix

- Removed `class="relative"` from `#wallet-container` (was creating stacking context)
- `handleClickOutside()` skips when modals are open

### npm Dependencies Added
- `qrcode` v1.5.4
- `@types/qrcode`

### Deferred / Future Work from Send/Receive Design Sessions (Feb 5)

These items were discussed but NOT yet implemented:

1. **ckToken support in Send modal** — Rob wants to expand beyond ICP/icUSD to include:
   - ckBTC, ckETH, ckXAUT, ckLINK, ckDOGE, ckWSTETH
   - NO stablecoins (ckUSDT, ckUSDC excluded from quick-select)
   - UI: quick-select icons for common tokens + dropdown for full list
   - Requires adding ledger canister IDs to config

2. **Token ledger canister IDs researched** (mainnet):
   - ckBTC: `mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai`
   - ckETH: `ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai`
   - ckUSDT: `cngnf-vqaaa-aaaar-qag4q-cai`
   - ckUSDC: `xevnm-gaaaa-aaaar-qafnq-cai`
   - (ckXAUT, ckLINK, ckDOGE, ckWSTETH — IDs need to be looked up)

3. **Testing checklist still outstanding:**
   - [ ] Test ICP transfer with Internet Identity
   - [ ] Test icUSD transfer with Internet Identity
   - [ ] Verify new `id.ai` portal authentication flow
   - [ ] Test Plug/Oisy disabled buttons and tooltip
   - [ ] Test QR code renders correctly in Receive modal

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Backend Build Errors (33 errors on main)

### Summary

The backend (`rumi_protocol_backend`) does not compile on `main`. This was introduced by the staging merge (`1cb0034`) which brought in Agnes's guard refactoring code that references State fields that were never added. **Production is not affected** — the currently deployed backend was built before the staging merge and is still running fine. But no backend changes can be deployed until this is fixed.

### Error Breakdown

| Error Type | Count | Source File | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `E0609: no field operation_guards` | 8 | `guard.rs` | `State` has no `operation_guards: BTreeSet<String>` field |
| `E0609: no field operation_details` | 8 | `guard.rs` | `State` has no `operation_details: BTreeMap<String, (Principal, String)>` field |
| `E0609: no field operation_guard_timestamps` | 7 | `guard.rs` | `State` has no `operation_guard_timestamps: BTreeMap<String, u64>` field |
| `E0308: mismatched types` | 6 | `guard.rs` | Cascade from missing fields (type inference failures) |
| `E0282: type annotations needed` | 4 | `guard.rs`, `lib.rs` | Cascade from missing fields |

### Root Cause

Agnes's staging branch refactored the guard system from **principal-based** guards to **operation-key-based** guards. The old system uses:
- `principal_guards: BTreeSet<Principal>` ✅ exists in State
- `principal_guard_timestamps: BTreeMap<Principal, u64>` ✅ exists in State
- `operation_states: BTreeMap<Principal, OperationState>` ✅ exists in State
- `operation_names: BTreeMap<Principal, String>` ✅ exists in State

The new guard code in `guard.rs` expects:
- `operation_guards: BTreeSet<String>` ❌ MISSING — keyed by `"principal:operation_name"` strings
- `operation_guard_timestamps: BTreeMap<String, u64>` ❌ MISSING — same string keys
- `operation_details: BTreeMap<String, (Principal, String)>` ❌ MISSING — maps key → (principal, operation_name)

The guard.rs was merged from staging but the corresponding State struct updates were lost in conflict resolution (we kept main's state.rs during the merge).

### How guard.rs Works (New System)

The refactored guard creates composite operation keys like `"fd7h3-mgmok...:open_vault"` combining principal + operation name. This allows a single principal to have multiple concurrent operations of different types (e.g., opening a vault while also doing a repayment), which the old principal-only system didn't support.

Key functions in `guard.rs`:
- `create_operation_key(principal, operation_name) → String` — creates the composite key
- `VaultGuard::new(principal, operation_name)` — acquires guard, cleans stale guards (5-min timeout)
- `VaultGuard::complete(self)` — marks operation as completed
- `Drop for VaultGuard` — cleanup on drop, removes guard from all tracking maps
- `MAX_CONCURRENT = 100` — max concurrent operations
- `GUARD_TIMEOUT_NANOS = 5 * 60 * 1_000_000_000` — 5-minute timeout

### Fix Required

Add three fields to `State` struct in `state.rs` (around line 127):

```rust
// Operation-key-based guards (from guard.rs refactor)
pub operation_guards: BTreeSet<String>,
pub operation_guard_timestamps: BTreeMap<String, u64>,
pub operation_details: BTreeMap<String, (Principal, String)>,
```

And initialize them in `impl From<InitArg> for State` (around line 165):

```rust
operation_guards: BTreeSet::new(),
operation_guard_timestamps: BTreeMap::new(),
operation_details: BTreeMap::new(),
```

**Decision needed:** Should the old principal-based guard fields (`principal_guards`, `principal_guard_timestamps`, `operation_states`, `operation_names`) be removed, or kept for backward compatibility? The new guard.rs code doesn't use them, but removing them may affect state deserialization on upgrade.

### What This Blocks

- ❌ Backend deployment to mainnet (any changes)
- ❌ XRC interval reduction (PR #3 — would save ~$46/month in oracle costs)
- ❌ Price freshness validation on liquidation endpoints
- ❌ Any future backend feature work

### What Still Works

- ✅ Frontend-only deploys (`dfx deploy vault_frontend --network ic`)
- ✅ Currently running backend on mainnet (old build, pre-merge)
- ✅ All user-facing functionality (vaults, transfers, wallet integration)

---

## XRC Cost Reduction — Pending Build Fix

### Current Cost
- ICP/USD fetched every **60 seconds** via XRC
- 1,440 calls/day × 1B cycles/call = ~1.44T cycles/day ≈ **$1.95/day ($58.50/month)**

### Planned Change (on `feature/liquidation-price-check`, PR #3)
- Increase `FETCHING_ICP_RATE_INTERVAL_SECS` from 60 → 300 (5 minutes)
- Reduces to 288 calls/day ≈ **$0.39/day ($11.70/month)** — 80% savings
- Safe because `check_price_not_too_old()` in state.rs uses a **10-minute** staleness threshold (`TEN_MINS_NANOS`), giving 2x buffer over the 5-minute fetch interval
- Note: `validate_call()` already calls `check_price_not_too_old()` on ALL endpoints including liquidations, so the separate `validate_price_for_liquidation()` in the PR is redundant but harmless

### Future: USDT/USDC Price Feeds
- For ckUSDT/ckUSDC repayment support, will need USDT/USD and USDC/USD prices
- Recommended approach: **on-demand fetching only** during liquidation/repayment operations, not polling
- Depeg threshold: reject if rate < $0.95 or > $1.05
- This avoids tripling the XRC bill from constant polling

## Core Protocol Mechanics

### Vault Operations
- **Collateral**: ICP only for MVP (ckBTC, ckETH planned)
- **Minimum Collateral Ratio**: 133% (`dec!(1.33)` in code)
- **Recovery Mode**: Triggers when system-wide CR < 150% (liquidation threshold rises to 150%)
- **Read-Only Mode**: Triggers when system-wide CR < 100% or oracle < $0.01
- **Borrowing Fee**: 0.5% one-time (0% in Recovery mode)
- **Liquidation Bonus**: 10%
- **Price Oracle**: XRC canister, 300s background polling + 30s on-demand freshness for operations

### Key Backend Functions (from .did file)
```candid
// Vault Management
open_vault : (amount_e8s: nat64) -> (Result)
borrow_from_vault : (vault_id: nat64, amount_e8s: nat64) -> (Result)
repay_to_vault : (vault_id: nat64, amount_e8s: nat64) -> (Result)
add_margin_to_vault : (vault_id: nat64, amount_e8s: nat64) -> (Result)
withdraw_collateral : (vault_id: nat64, amount_e8s: nat64) -> (Result)
withdraw_collateral_and_close_vault : (vault_id: nat64) -> (Result)

// Partial Operations (NEW from staging merge)
partial_repay_to_vault : (VaultArg) -> (Result)
partial_liquidate_vault : (VaultArg) -> (Result)

// ICRC Standards (for Oisy wallet)
icrc21_canister_call_consent_message : (Request) -> (Result)
icrc28_trusted_origins : () -> (Response) query
icrc10_supported_standards : () -> (vec StandardRecord) query

// Queries
get_vault : (vault_id: nat64) -> (opt Vault) query
get_vaults_by_owner : (owner: principal) -> (vec Vault) query
get_protocol_status : () -> (ProtocolStatus) query
get_icp_price : () -> (nat64) query

## Wallet Integration Status

### Supported Wallets
| Wallet | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Plug** | ✅ Working | Primary testing wallet |
| **Internet Identity** | ✅ Working | Send/Receive implemented, uses `https://id.ai` portal |
| **Oisy** | 🔴 Greyed out ("Coming Soon") | ICRC-2 incompatible with ICP ledger; icUSD untested. Disabled in wallet selector. |

### Oisy Wallet - Current Status

**Known:** Oisy CANNOT do ICRC-2 operations on the **ICP ledger** (vault creation collateral).
- Solution implemented: Push-deposit pattern for ICP collateral

**Unknown (Testing):** Can Oisy do ICRC-2 on the **icUSD ledger**?
- Test branch deployed: `test/oisy-icrc2-repayment`
- Test URL: https://rumiprotocol.io
- Look for `[TEST-ICRC2]` logs in browser console
- See `/docs/archive/OISY_ICRC2_TEST_SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for full details

**If icUSD ICRC-2 fails:** Will need push-style repayment implementation.

---

## Known Bugs

### 1. Vault Close Navigation Bug
**File**: `src/vault_frontend/src/lib/components/vault/VaultDetails.svelte`
**Problem**: After closing vault, page stays on `/vaults/[id]` instead of redirecting to `/vaults`
**Tried**: Event dispatch, direct `goto()`, even `window.location.href` - none worked
**Status**: Needs investigation - deployed code may not match source

### ~~2. Plug Wallet Auto-Reconnect~~ ✅ RESOLVED

### ~~3. Left Nav Active Highlight Doesn't Track Page~~ ✅ RESOLVED
**Fix**: Replaced manual `window.location` check with SvelteKit `$page` store
**Branch**: `feature/ui-updates`

---

## UI Rebrand & Page Reworks (February 6–7, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/ui-updates` (local only — NOT deployed to production)

**Goal:** Elevate the UI from template-feeling to a sleek, modern DeFi product. Make it feel like crypto people built it.

### Design System — `/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
A formal design constitution was established and governs all UI decisions:
- **Three-color system**: indigo base (#080b16), purple/pink identity (#d176e8), emerald action (#34d399)
- **Typography**: Circular Std headings, Inter body/numbers
- **Primary Brand** (transactional pages): no gradients, serious infrastructure aesthetic
- **Secondary Brand** (marketing/educational): gradients allowed
- **Card hover**: purple inner glow on interactive card grids only
- **Button text**: dark on emerald fills
- **Risk colors**: amber (caution), red (danger). No green "safe" states.
- **Noise grain**: SVG feTurbulence at 3% opacity over body — felt, not seen
- **Depth cues**: Inset top-edge highlight + purple-tinted shadows on all cards

### Global CSS / Design Foundation
| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Background surfaces** | Indigo/blue-purple family: #080b16 (page), #0e1222 (surface1), #141a2e (surface2), #1a2139 (surface3) |
| **Noise grain** | `body::after` SVG fractalNoise at 3% opacity, fixed, pointer-events none |
| **Depth cues** | Inset highlight + 2-layer shadow on `.glass-panel`, `.glass-card`, `.icp-card`, `.price-card` |
| **Purple inner-glow hover** | Cards get faint purple glow on hover via inset box-shadow |
| **Ambient glow** | `body::before` radial gradient, indigo-tinted, centered top |
| **Color calibration** | Emerald (#34d399) for action, teal (#2DD4BF) for subtle accents, #d176e8 for identity/orientation |
| **Typography scale** | Logo 2rem, nav 0.9375rem, page titles 2rem bold purple-accent, key numbers Inter 700 tabular |
| **Debug toggle** | Debug panels hidden by default, Ctrl+D to toggle (dev mode only) |

### Header Redesign
- CSS Grid layout with true viewport-centered nav
- Green underline active state on nav items
- Single amber "Beta" chip, left of social icons, tooltip on hover

### Page Reworks

#### Borrow (Home) + Stability Pool
- **Action-first layout**: left column = action card, right column = protocol stats
- Stability Pool page stripped of pink gradients, matches Primary Brand
- Step numbers use muted text (not teal), headlines solid off-white

#### Learn → Docs
Replaced old "Learn" page with structured documentation (5 sub-pages sourced from actual Rust code):
- Before You Borrow, Liquidation Mechanics, What Can Go Wrong, Protocol Parameters, Beta Disclaimer
- **Important correction**: Old Learn page said 130% MCR. Actual code is 133% (`dec!(1.33)`).

#### Redeem + Treasury
- Removed old pink-to-purple gradient headlines → `.page-title` class
- Removed gradient buttons → `.btn-primary` class

#### Vaults — Vault Management Spec Compliance (Feb 7)
Dense, expandable inline vault list with full risk-forward UX:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **CR-ascending sort** | Riskiest vaults always at top, vault ID tiebreaker |
| **Single active intent** | Add/Borrow/Repay mutually exclusive — others clear when one is populated |
| **Add Collateral Max** | Shows wallet ICP balance, neutral color, inline clickable text |
| **Borrow Max** | Amount that results in CR = 150% |
| **Repay Max** | min(wallet icUSD balance, outstanding debt) |
| **Max styling** | All three identical: `--rumi-text-muted`, no action color, subtle hover underline |
| **Input behavior** | User types freely — no clamping, no value substitution. Over-max inputs grey out the button. |
| **Over-max disable** | Buttons disabled + handler hard-guarded when input exceeds max (Add, Borrow, Repay all guarded) |
| **Single expanded vault** | Only one vault can be expanded at a time; opening another closes the previous and resets inputs |
| **Projected CR** | Shown inline next to action button, live color: neutral ≥150%, amber 140-149%, red <140% |
| **Action disable** | Buttons disabled when projected CR is below minimum |
| **Risk left-border** | Danger vaults get 2px red left edge, warning vaults get amber |
| **Stable ordering** | Expanding/collapsing a vault does NOT reorder the list |
| **No sort controls** | No dropdowns, toggles, or configuration for MVP |

#### Liquidations — Row-Card Redesign (Feb 7, v3)
Complete structural redesign of the liquidation experience, iterated through multiple passes:

**Layout: Three-zone card**
| Zone | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Left** | Risk stats: CR badge (semantic color + warning icon), Debt, Collateral |
| **Center** | "You receive" outcome: ICP amount (bold) + USD value (muted). Appears when user types input. |
| **Right** | Execution: "Amount to liquidate" input + "Liquidate" button |

**Interaction model:**
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Unified flow** | ONE liquidation path. User inputs icUSD amount, protocol handles full vs partial internally (≥99.9% of debt = full) |
| **No mode switching** | Removed "Partial / Full" distinction entirely |
| **Input freedom** | User types freely — no clamping, no value substitution |
| **Over-max behavior** | Input text + button grey out. Button unclickable. No error message on separate line. |
| **Max utility text** | Neutral color, hover underline. NOT a button, NOT action-colored. Shows "Max: ····" pulse placeholder while wallet balance loads. |
| **Max cap logic** | Calculates minimum icUSD needed to restore vault CR to ~150%, capped to min(wallet balance, vault debt, restoration amount) |
| **Liquidate button** | Emerald green (action color). Disabled until valid input > 0 and ≤ max. Hard-guarded in handler too. |
| **CR coloring** | Red <130%, amber 130-150%. Warning icon on danger. ONLY colored element in card. |
| **No hover expansion** | Subtle purple border glow only. No layout shifts. |
| **Sort** | CR ascending (riskiest first), vault ID tiebreaker |

**Copy (locked):**
- Input label: "Amount to liquidate" (not "Repay")
- Outcome: "You receive" / "0.4472 ICP $1.11" (no parentheses, no "Est.", no abbreviations)

**⚠️ KNOWN BUG: "You receive" reactivity**
The center-column seizure calculation does NOT update live when the user types. Currently requires clicking "Refresh" to recalculate. The root cause is Svelte reactivity — `liquidationAmounts` is a plain object and property mutations don't trigger re-renders. A self-assignment trick (`liquidationAmounts = liquidationAmounts`) was attempted but did not resolve the issue in production. This needs a proper fix, likely by:
- Converting `liquidationAmounts` to a Svelte store, OR
- Using a reactive `$:` block that watches a serialized version of the amounts, OR
- Moving to per-vault component state (like VaultCard does)

## Protocol Constants Centralization (February 9, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/ui-updates` — Commit `6bff0d1`

### Problem
Protocol-critical numbers (minimum CR, liquidation threshold) were hardcoded in multiple places across the frontend with inconsistent values. `VaultCard.svelte` had `MINT_MINIMUM = 1.5` and `E8S = 100_000_000` as local constants, and `getRiskLevel()` used hardcoded thresholds (`1.5`, `1.4`) that didn't match actual protocol parameters. The `config.ts` settings object also had wrong values (`minCollateralRatio: 130`, `liquidationThreshold: 125`). If protocol parameters ever change, tracking down every hardcoded instance would be a nightmare.

### Solution: `src/vault_frontend/src/lib/protocol.ts`
Created a single source of truth for protocol parameters on the frontend:

```typescript
export const MINIMUM_CR = 1.5;        // 150% — min to open/borrow (backend: RECOVERY_COLLATERAL_RATIO)
export const LIQUIDATION_CR = 1.33;   // 133% — liquidation threshold (backend: MINIMUM_COLLATERAL_RATIO)
export const E8S = 100_000_000;
```

**Backend source:** `src/rumi_protocol_backend/src/lib.rs` lines 56–57:
```rust
pub const RECOVERY_COLLATERAL_RATIO: Ratio = Ratio::new(dec!(1.5));   // 150%
pub const MINIMUM_COLLATERAL_RATIO: Ratio = Ratio::new(dec!(1.33));   // 133%
```

**Naming note:** The backend names are confusing — `MINIMUM_COLLATERAL_RATIO` is actually the *liquidation* threshold, while `RECOVERY_COLLATERAL_RATIO` is the minimum to open/borrow. The frontend names (`MINIMUM_CR`, `LIQUIDATION_CR`) are more intuitive.

### Risk Level Thresholds (corrected)
| CR Range | Risk Level | Color | Icon |
|----------|-----------|-------|------|
| ≥ 150% (`MINIMUM_CR`) | `normal` | Neutral white | None |
| 133%–150% (`LIQUIDATION_CR` to `MINIMUM_CR`) | `warning` | Amber | ⚠ |
| ≤ 133% (`LIQUIDATION_CR`) | `danger` | Red | ⚠ |

**Exception:** Projected CR preview (when user types into Add Collateral / Borrow / Repay fields) uses green for `normal` to signal "this action improves your position."

### Migration Checklist
`VaultCard.svelte` now imports from `$lib/protocol` instead of local constants. Other files that may still have hardcoded values should be migrated:
- [ ] `config.ts` — `CONFIG.settings` object has wrong values (130%, 125%) — remove or update
- [ ] Liquidation page components — check for hardcoded ratio thresholds
- [ ] Borrow page — check max borrowable calculations
- [ ] Any future components that reference protocol ratios

## XRC Price Oracle Cost Optimization (February 9, 2026)

**Branch:** `feature/xrc-cost-optimization` (off `feature/ui-updates`)

### Problem
The XRC (Exchange Rate Canister) was being polled every 60 seconds for the ICP/USD price, costing ~$58/month in cycles. This is the single largest operational cost for the backend canister. Most of these calls are wasted — the price only matters when a user actually performs a vault operation.

### Solution: Lazy Polling + On-Demand Freshness

**Two-layer approach:**

1. **Background timer polls lazily every 300s (5 min)** — just keeps a reasonably fresh price in state for display/queries on the frontend. Reduces cycle cost by ~80% to ~$12/month.

2. **On-demand fetch for price-sensitive operations** — when any price-sensitive function is called, `validate_call()` (now async) checks if the cached price is older than 30 seconds. If so, it triggers an immediate XRC fetch before proceeding. The user's operation always uses a fresh price.

### Code Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `xrc.rs` | `FETCHING_ICP_RATE_INTERVAL`: 60s → 300s |
| `xrc.rs` | Added `PRICE_FRESHNESS_THRESHOLD_NANOS` (30s) |
| `xrc.rs` | Added `ensure_fresh_price()` — checks cache age, fetches on-demand if stale |
| `main.rs` | `validate_call()` changed from sync → async, now calls `ensure_fresh_price().await` |
| `main.rs` | All 14 callers updated: `validate_call()?` → `validate_call().await?` |

### Price-Sensitive Functions (14 total)

All go through `validate_call()` → `ensure_fresh_price()`:

**Vault operations (user-initiated, all need fresh price):**
- `open_vault` — calculates collateral ratio from price
- `borrow_from_vault` — calculates how much can be minted at current CR
- `repay_to_vault` — updates CR after debt reduction
- `partial_repay_to_vault` — same as repay
- `add_margin_to_vault` — updates CR after collateral addition
- `close_vault` — needs accurate CR for safety checks
- `withdraw_collateral` — needs accurate CR to prevent undercollateralization
- `withdraw_and_close_vault` — same as close

**Liquidations (user-initiated, critical — must have fresh price):**
- `liquidate_vault` — determines if vault is actually undercollateralized
- `partial_liquidate_vault` — same

**Redemptions (user-initiated, needs fresh price):**
- `redeem_icp` — calculates ICP to return for icUSD redeemed

**Stability pool (user-initiated, arguably don't need fresh price):**
- `provide_liquidity` — deposits icUSD into stability pool (no CR calculation)
- `withdraw_liquidity` — withdraws icUSD from stability pool (no CR calculation)
- `claim_liquidity_returns` — claims accumulated returns (no CR calculation)

> **Note:** The three stability pool functions don't perform collateral ratio calculations and arguably don't need a fresh price. We left them with the price check for now (conservative approach), but they could be split out to skip the on-demand fetch if we want to save users the occasional 1-2s delay.

> **Note:** `redeem_icp` is named for the current ICP-only collateral. When we add ckBTC, ckETH, or other collateral types, the redemption function will need to be generalized (e.g., `redeem_collateral` with a collateral type parameter) and each collateral's price will need its own freshness guarantee. This is a future architecture concern to revisit when multi-collateral is implemented.

### Concurrency Safety

The existing `FetchXrcGuard` prevents concurrent XRC calls. If two users trigger actions simultaneously when the price is stale, only one XRC call fires. The second user's `ensure_fresh_price()` calls `fetch_icp_rate()` which silently returns (guard blocks it), but by then the first fetch has already updated the price in state, so the subsequent `check_price_not_too_old()` passes.

### Future Work: Admin-Configurable Interval

Discussed but not yet implemented: a controller-only `set_price_interval(secs: u64)` function that stores the interval in stable memory. Would allow changing the polling interval without redeploying. Currently the canister has zero admin-only functions — this would be the first, establishing the controller-check pattern. See [chat log](https://claude.ai/chat/c89c7960-62cd-40fc-8c69-63dd762bb743) for full discussion.

### Future Work: Multi-Collateral Price Feeds

When additional collateral types (ckBTC, ckETH) are added, `ensure_fresh_price()` will need to become collateral-aware — checking and refreshing the price for the specific collateral involved in the operation, not just ICP. The `FETCHING_CKBTC_RATE_INTERVAL` and `fetch_ckbtc_rate()` references already exist in `setup_timers()` in `main.rs` (from Agnes's staging merge) but the corresponding functions in `xrc.rs` haven't been implemented yet.
