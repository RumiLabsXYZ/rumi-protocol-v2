  <section class="doc-section">
    <h2 class="doc-heading">Status</h2>
    <p>Rumi Protocol is in beta. The software is functional and deployed on the Internet Computer mainnet, but it has not been formally audited and should be considered experimental.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc-section">
    <h2 class="doc-heading">No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The protocol is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Rumi Labs LLC makes no guarantees about the correctness, reliability, or security of the software. Use of the protocol is entirely at your own risk.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc-section">
    <h2 class="doc-heading">Risk of Loss</h2>
    <p>You may lose some or all of the assets you deposit into the protocol. This can happen due to smart contract bugs, oracle failures, liquidation events, or other causes described in the <a href="/docs/risks" class="doc-link">risk documentation</a>. Do not deposit more than you can afford to lose.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc-section">
    <h2 class="doc-heading">No Audit</h2>
    <p>The Rumi Protocol codebase has not undergone a formal third-party security audit. While the development team reviews code before deployment, undiscovered vulnerabilities may exist.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="doc-section">
    <h2 class="doc-heading">Canister Control</h2>
    <p>Protocol canisters are currently controlled by the development team's principals. This means the team can upgrade canister code at any time without a governance vote or time-lock. While this enables rapid bug fixes, it also means you are trusting the team not to deploy malicious or broken code.</p>

    <h2 class="doc-heading">Not Financial Advice</h2>
